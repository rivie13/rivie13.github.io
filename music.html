          the actual composer of this song has been argued but according to current records I believe I was mistaken,
          the true composer is (or argued to be) Francesco Bartolomeo Conti. You can also find arrangments of this song at the previous link

          <h2>Barber and Schumann: Hermit Songs and Dichterliebe</h2>
          <p>
            This is an embedded youtube video of my recent recital where I performed Hermit Songs and Dichterliebe (translates to "A poet's love"). Both of these song cycles
            mean a lot to me and I have wanted to perform them both for a long time; this year I got to perform the Dichterliebe twice which was truly special for me. I was so happy
            that I was joined by my good friend who accompanied me on the piano. This recital was probably my most favorite performance ever; it was truly special for me. I truly hope you enjoy it.
          </p>
          <p>Hermit Songs is a song cycle by Samuel Barber, a Philadelphia native and one of the finest composers of the 20th Century.
            Rarely have I found music that evokes as much emotion as these 10 songs. Barber also has a knack for making his music really
            sound like the thing/feeling/idea he is trying to get across.
            There is no IMSLP link for the Hermit Songs as these are still relatively new and their copyright hasn't expired yet.

          <p>Dichterliebe is a song cycle by Robert Schumann, a European composer who wrote many german songs (including these).
             This is arguably his most famous work, and is one of if not the most famous song cycle of all time. This music tells a
             story as old as time, the story of falling in love and out of love due to heartbreak but also the forgiveness that comes after.
             This <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Dichterliebe,_Op.48_(Schumann,_Robert)">link</a> takes you to the IMSLP page for Dichterliebe.
