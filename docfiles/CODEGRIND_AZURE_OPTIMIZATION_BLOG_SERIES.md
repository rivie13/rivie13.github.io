# CodeGrind Azure Optimization Blog Series: From Costly VMs to Smart Serverless Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines a planned series of blog posts that will detail our journey optimizing CodeGrind's Azure infrastructure. The series will focus on how we transformed our code execution engine from an always-on VM to an intelligent, on-demand system using Azure Functions, while also improving our security posture through Azure Key Vault integration.
