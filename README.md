My first website!


This is the code for my first website that I am creating myself. This static website is going to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the components within it.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach me through github at rivie13 or you can email me at riviera.t.sperduto13@gmail.com

If you would like to learn more about me or my work, then you will have to go on my website to find further information.
