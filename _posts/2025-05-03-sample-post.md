This is a sample blog post template that can be used as a reference for future posts. Jekyll uses Markdown formatting which makes it easy to write and format content.

## Markdown Formatting

### Headers

You can use hashtags (#) to create headers. More hashtags create smaller headers.

### Emphasis

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

### Lists

Unordered list:
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

Ordered list:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Links

[Text to display](http://www.example.com)

### Images

![Alt text for image](/assets/images/your-image.jpg)

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory

3. Include the front matter at the top (like this post)
